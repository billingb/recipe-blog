Chocolate chip cookies are the most requested recipe I make, and the first one I'll post here. This
 recipe took me years to develop with many false starts with alternative sweeteners and
 different flour mixes. Finally two different sources helped me develop the winning
 formula. The base recipe is adapted from <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Light-Recipe-Editors-Illustrated-magazine/dp/0936184973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474909923&sr=8-1&keywords=the+best+light+recipe+cookbook">
 The Best Light Recipe</a> by "Editors of Cook's Illustrated magazine". I then made some adjustments
  guided by
 <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474910043&sr=8-1&keywords=on+food+and+cooking">
 On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> by Harold McGee. 
 
 After using these sources to develop a good starting point I replaced some butter with
 oil to reduce saturated fat and replaced some white flour with whole wheat to make
 them more healthy. I also reduced the sugar some.
 
 After making these adjustments the last step was to nail the cooking time. It is 
 important that if you want a chewy cookie these not be overcooked, it is better to remove
 them looking a little underdone if you're unsure.
 
 That was the final trick. Over a few years of making this recipe and bringing cookies
 to a variety of events I'm confident this is a great recipe as I get complements everytime
 I bring these. I never mention they are healthier then a standard cookie, but that is a 
 nice bonus.
