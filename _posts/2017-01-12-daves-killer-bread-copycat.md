Dave's Killer Bread is one of my favorite store bought breads so I set out to create a recipe I can make
at home and enjoy just as much. After some trial and error I created this recipe. It has a lot of the 
different grains in Dave's bread. If you're missing something don't hesitate to substitute another ingredient,
in particular the oats can be increased to make up for missing ingredients with little risk.

This is currently my favorite bread recipe, with a complex taste and wonderful texture, the only struggle
is not eating an entire loaf as soon as it comes out of the oven.
