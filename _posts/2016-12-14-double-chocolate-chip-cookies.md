After creating my chocolate chip cookie recipe I knew the next step was making a double chocolate chip recipe I love.
This recipe is my kids favorite cookie I make, and is frequently requested when I ask what to make. This recipe was 
actually easy to adapt, I simply added cocoa and took out some flour from my chocolate chip cookie recipe. Make sure
you have enough milk on hand when making these!
  
 As with my chocolate chip cookies it is 
 critical to not overcook this recipe, it is better to remove them looking a little underdone if you're unsure.
