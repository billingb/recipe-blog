Welcome to my recipe blog! I'm excited to start sharing recipes that I've 
developed over the years!

My focus is on making great tasting food that is healthy. I follow no strict 
diet, so you'll still find white flour and refined sugar in these recipes. However,
I do modify my recipes to reduce less healthy ingredients and increase healthy ingredients.

I believe in moderation for foods. I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and limit refined
foods. I eat more carbs in the morning and less in the afternoon and evening. My family
also eats dessert type foods in the morning rather then at supper time after I started
seeing research to support this change in our diet, see this article for details:

I am also active, I do the majority of my commuting by bike, take the opportunity to walk
whenever I can and play with my kids. I get least a few hours dedicated exercise time each week.
