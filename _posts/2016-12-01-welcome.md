Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing recipes that I've 
developed over the years!

I enjoy creating recipes that are relatively health and taste great. I follow no strict 
diet, so you'll still find white flour and refined sugar in these recipes. However,
I do modify my recipes to reduce less healthy ingredients and increase healthy ingredients.

I think moderation is key for healthy living. I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and limit refined
foods. I eat more carbohydrates in the morning and less in the afternoon and evening. To this end my family
eats dessert type foods at breakfast rather then at supper time. We started this after reading research to 
support eating a treat in the morning, see this article for details:

I am also active, I do the majority of my commuting by bike, take the opportunity to walk
whenever I can and play with my kids. I get least a few hours dedicated exercise time each week.
