  A double chocolate chip version of my classic chocolate chip cookies. These are my kids favorite cookie I bake.
  These cookies are best if they aren't overcooked, if in doubt pull them out a little sooner. If you like nuts
  consider adding a 1/2 cup of walnuts or any other nuts. You may want to double the recipe if you want a large batch of cookies.
