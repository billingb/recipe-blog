  This is a wonderful bread with lots of flavor and texture. Inspired by Dave's Killer Bread, it shares most of those ingredients
  while providing that homemade bread taste that can't be beat! The directions assume a stand mixer, but the
  recipe should work fine with a bread machine or by hand technique.

directions:

  - Mix on low for about 2 minutes until well combined. Add 1 cup flour and mix until fully incorporated. Add 1 more cup flour and mix for another minute.
  - Add seeds and continue to mix for at least on more minute or until fully combined. If the dough looks to wet add a little more flour until it looks right (I've never need to do this).
  - Rise in a wam place until double in bulk. Punch down and rise again for best texture, or skip second rise if you don't want to wait.
  - Punch down and shape into two greased loaf pans. Rise until doubled in bulk, approximitely 45 minutes.
