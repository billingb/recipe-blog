  Very flavorful chili, one of my favorite comfort foods. This can be made with or without the ground turkey, or
  substitute meat of your choice. I sometimes add a bottle of beer.

directions:
  - Cook beans if using dry, I do this by soaking overnight and then cooking for 10 minutes in a pressure cooker.
  - In a soup pot cook onions, green bell peppers, garlic and turkey with salt until onions and turkey are cooked.
  - Add drained beans and cumin through water to soup pot. Add more water as needed for wetness you prefer. Cook over low heat for at least 1 hour, preferable a 2-3 hours for flavors to combine.
