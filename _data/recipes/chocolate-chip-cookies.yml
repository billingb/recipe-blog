  My healthier but still dessert choclate chip cookie receipe is my go to for any occasion. This cookie always
  gets compliments and is often requested by friends and coworkers. These cookies are best if they aren't overcooked,
  if in doubt pull them out a little sooner. The recipe calls for Pecans, but you can substitute other nuts or leave the
  nuts out entirely. You may want to double the recipe if you want a large batch of cookies.
